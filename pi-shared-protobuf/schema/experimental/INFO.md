# OnPrem Phoenix SQL Schema

The `master_onprem_phx_schema.sql` is executed whenever the ip-flow or datastore-onprem is initialised to ensure the schema is current.

The SQuirreLSQL app can be used with the cloudera phoenix 4.9 jbdc bundled client jar added to it's lib folder.

Alternatively, from the CLI, SqlLine can be used.
